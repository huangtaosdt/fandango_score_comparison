In this project,I'll be working with the file fandango_score_comparison.csv.Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

FILM - film name.
RottenTomatoes - Rotten Tomatoes critics average score.
RottenTomatoes_User - Rotten Tomatoes user average score.
RT_norm - Rotten Tomatoes critics average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).
RT_user_norm - Rotten Tomatoes user average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).
Metacritic - Metacritic critics average score.
Metacritic_user_nom - Metacritic user average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).
Metacritic_norm - Metacritic critics average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).
Fandango_Ratingvalue - Fandango user average score (0 to 5 stars).
IMDB_norm - IMDB user average score (normalized to a 0 to 5 point scale).

In this project, I will make a comparison by calculating statistical values,such as mean,variance,standard deviation，
covariance，correlation and so on.
